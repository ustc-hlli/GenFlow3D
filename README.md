## Preproration
To run our model, install the PointNet2 library first as follows.
```
cd pointnet2
python setup.py install
cd ..
```
After this, we need to prepare the sequential scene flow datasets nuScenes and Argoverse 2.

### nuScenes
The code to preprocess the nuScenes dataset is in `./data/nuscenes`. We follow [SLIM](https://github.com/mercedes-benz/selfsupervised_flow) to generate the scene flow ground truth.
First, download the full nuScenes v1.0 trainval dataset from the [official website](https://www.nuscenes.org/nuscenes#download). Then unzip them. The directory structure should be as follows.
```
your_path_to_nuscenes-|
                      |-
```
